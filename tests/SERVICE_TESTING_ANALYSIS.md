## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (üî¥ High Priority)

1. ‚úÖ **~~Create missing unit tests~~** ~~for PaymentService~~ **COMPLETED**
2. ‚úÖ **~~Add Stripe integration tests~~** ~~for ReservationService~~ **COMPLETED** (UserSubscriptionService no longer needs Stripe tests)
3. ‚úÖ **~~Standardize on Pest syntax~~** ~~for consistency~~ **COMPLETED**

### Medium Priority Actions (üü° Medium Priority)

1. **Add feature tests** for MemberProfileService member directory workflows
2. ‚úÖ **~~Create unit tests~~** ~~for StaffProfileService and ReportService~~ **COMPLETED**
3. ‚úÖ **~~Add user story documentation~~** ~~for core business services~~ **COMPLETED**

### Long-term Improvements (‚ö™ Low Priority)

1. **Integration test suite** covering service interactions
2. **Performance testing** for caching and database-heavy operations
3. **Error handling test coverage** across all services

## Implementation Priority Order

Based on BandService and UserService as the gold standards (complete unit tests, feature tests, user stories, Pest syntax, excellent organization), the priority order for bringing other services up to standard should be:

### Phase 1: Critical Missing Unit Tests

1. **PaymentService** - Add missing unit tests (20 methods)

### Phase 2: Incomplete Coverage  

2. **ReservationService** - Add missing Stripe integration tests
3. **UserSubscriptionService** - Add missing Stripe subscription tests

### Phase 3: Missing Feature Tests

4. **MemberProfileService** - Add feature test suite for member directory workflows

### Phase 4: Framework Standardization

5. Convert PHPUnit tests to Pest syntax:
   - ReservationService
   - MemberProfileService  
   - UserSubscriptionService
   - Infrastructure services
