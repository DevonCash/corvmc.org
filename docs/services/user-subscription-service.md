# UserSubscriptionService  

The UserSubscriptionService manages membership levels, subscription processing, and benefit tracking for the Corvallis Music Collective's sustaining member program.

## Purpose & Responsibilities

The UserSubscriptionService encapsulates the complex business logic required to manage a hybrid membership system that supports both role-based and transaction-based sustaining memberships. It provides automated processing of recurring donations, tracks membership benefits like free practice hours, and maintains comprehensive analytics for the collective's subscription program. The service ensures consistent membership status determination across the platform while providing administrative tools for manual membership management and subscription oversight.

This service is critical for maintaining the financial sustainability of the collective through its membership program. It automates the processing of recurring donations from payment systems like Stripe, automatically granting membership benefits to qualifying donors while providing manual override capabilities for special cases like volunteers or staff. The service coordinates with the reservation system to track benefit usage, generates detailed analytics for program management, and provides proactive monitoring of subscription health to prevent membership lapses.

## Usage Examples

### Checking and Managing Membership Status
```php
$service = new UserSubscriptionService();
$user = User::find(1);

// Check membership status
if ($service->isSustainingMember($user)) {
    $status = $service->getSubscriptionStatus($user);
    
    echo "Member via: " . $status['method'];
    echo "Free hours remaining: " . $status['free_hours_remaining'];
    
    if ($status['method'] === 'transaction' && $status['expires_at']) {
        echo "Expires: " . $status['expires_at']->format('M j, Y');
    }
}

// Manual membership management
$volunteer = User::find(5);
$service->grantSustainingMemberStatus($volunteer);
echo $volunteer->name . " is now a sustaining member";
```

### Processing Subscription Payments
```php
// Webhook from payment processor (Stripe, etc.)
$transactionData = [
    'email' => 'donor@example.com',
    'type' => 'recurring',
    'amount' => 25.00,
    'status' => 'completed',
    'stripe_payment_id' => 'pi_1234567890'
];

$transaction = Transaction::create($transactionData);

// Process transaction - automatically grants benefits
if ($service->processTransaction($transaction)) {
    $user = User::where('email', $transaction->email)->first();
    
    // Send confirmation email
    Mail::to($user)->send(new SustainingMemberWelcome($user));
    
    echo $user->name . " is now a sustaining member via donation!";
}
```

### Administrative Reporting and Management
```php
// Generate dashboard statistics
$stats = $service->getSubscriptionStatistics();

echo "Program Overview:";
echo "Total sustaining members: " . $stats['total_sustaining_members'];
echo "Monthly recurring revenue: $" . number_format($stats['monthly_recurring_revenue'], 2);
echo "Average donation: $" . number_format($stats['average_transaction_amount'], 2);

// Member breakdown
echo "Role-based members: " . $stats['role_based_members'];
echo "Transaction-based members: " . $stats['transaction_based_members'];

// Find members needing renewal reminders
$expiring = $service->getExpiringSubscriptions(7);
foreach ($expiring as $user) {
    echo $user->name . "'s subscription expires soon";
    // Queue renewal reminder email
    RenewalReminder::dispatch($user);
}
```

### Free Hours Usage Tracking
```php
$sustainingMember = User::find(10);

// Current month usage
$usage = $service->getFreeHoursUsage($sustainingMember);
echo "Used: " . $usage['total_hours'] . " of 4 free hours";
echo "Remaining: " . $usage['remaining_hours'] . " hours";

// Historical usage (specific month)
$lastMonth = now()->subMonth();
$historicalUsage = $service->getFreeHoursUsage($sustainingMember, $lastMonth);
echo "Last month usage: " . $historicalUsage['total_hours'] . " hours";

// List reservations that used free hours
foreach ($usage['reservations'] as $reservation) {
    echo "â€¢ " . $reservation->free_hours_used . " hours on " 
         . $reservation->reserved_at->format('M j, g:i A');
}
```

### Membership Analytics and Insights
```php
// Get all sustaining members for analysis
$allMembers = $service->getSustainingMembers();
$roleBasedMembers = $service->getSustainingMembersByRole();
$transactionBasedMembers = $service->getSustainingMembersByTransaction();

echo "Membership Breakdown:";
echo "Total: " . $allMembers->count();
echo "Via Role Assignment: " . $roleBasedMembers->count();
echo "Via Donations: " . $transactionBasedMembers->count();

// Analyze subscription health
$expiringIn30Days = $service->getExpiringSubscriptions(30);
$retentionRate = ($allMembers->count() - $expiringIn30Days->count()) / $allMembers->count() * 100;

echo "30-day retention rate: " . number_format($retentionRate, 1) . "%";
```
