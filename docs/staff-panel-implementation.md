# Staff Panel Implementation - Complete

## Overview

Successfully split the Filament application into two panels:

- `/staff` - Staff operations hub (administration, moderation, operations)

**Date**: 2025-10-02
**Duration**: ~2 hours
**Status**: ✅ Complete

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Staff Panel Provider
**File**: `app/Providers/Filament/StaffPanelProvider.php`

- Panel ID: `staff`
- Path: `/staff`
- Primary Color: Slate
- Navigation Groups:
  - User Management
  - Operations
  - Content & Moderation
  - System

### 2. Access Control Middleware
**File**: `app/Http/Middleware/EnsureUserIsStaff.php`

- Restricts `/staff` panel to users with roles: `admin`, `staff`, or `moderator`
- Returns 403 error for unauthorized access
- Registered in StaffPanelProvider `authMiddleware`

### 3. Resources Moved to Staff Panel

#### User Management Group
- **UserResource** (`app/Filament/Staff/Resources/Users/`)
  - User management
  - Invitations
  - Member profiles
  - Removed self-restriction logic (staff see all users)
  - Updated navigation group to "User Management"

#### System Group
- **ActivityLogResource** (`app/Filament/Staff/Resources/ActivityLog/`)
  - System activity logs
  - Activity widgets
  - Updated navigation group to "System"

#### Operations Group
- **EquipmentDamageReportResource** (`app/Filament/Staff/Resources/Equipment/EquipmentDamageReports/`)
  - Equipment damage reports
  - Approval workflow
  - Kept in "Operations" group

#### Content & Moderation Group
- **ReportResource** (`app/Filament/Staff/Resources/Reports/`)
  - Content reports
  - User reports
  - Moderation actions
  - Updated navigation group to "Content & Moderation"

- **RevisionResource** (`app/Filament/Staff/Resources/Revisions/`)
  - Content revision tracking
  - Change history
  - Updated navigation group to "Content & Moderation"

### 4. Panel Switcher Component
**File**: `resources/views/filament/components/panel-switcher.blade.php`

- Displays in user menu area of both panels
- Shows current panel with icon
- Allows quick switching between:
  - Member Panel (personal account & bands)
  - Staff Panel (operations & moderation)
- Only shows Staff Panel option if user has staff roles
- Visual indicators for active panel

**Integrated in**:
- `MemberPanelProvider` → `USER_MENU_BEFORE` hook
- `StaffPanelProvider` → `USER_MENU_BEFORE` hook

### 5. Panel Registration
**File**: `bootstrap/providers.php`

```php
return [
    App\Providers\AppServiceProvider::class,
    App\Providers\Filament\MemberPanelProvider::class,
    App\Providers\Filament\StaffPanelProvider::class,  // NEW
];
```

## Maintenance Notes

### Adding New Staff Resources

1. Create resource in `app/Filament/Staff/Resources/`
2. Set navigation group (User Management, Operations, Content & Moderation, or System)
3. No need for `shouldRegisterNavigation()` - middleware handles access
4. Use proper permissions in policies

### Adding New Member Resources

1. Create resource in `app/Filament/Resources/`
2. Set appropriate navigation group
3. All members can see (unless using policies)
4. Keep focused on member tasks

### Panel Switcher Customization

To modify the panel switcher, edit:
- `resources/views/filament/components/panel-switcher.blade.php`

To change placement, modify hooks in:
- `app/Providers/Filament/MemberPanelProvider.php`
- `app/Providers/Filament/StaffPanelProvider.php`

---

## Performance Impact

- **Member panel load time**: Reduced (fewer resources to register)
- **Staff panel load time**: Minimal increase (only loads when accessed)
- **Route caching**: Faster (separate route groups)
- **Navigation rendering**: Faster (less conditional logic)

---

## Security

- ✅ Middleware prevents unauthorized access to `/staff`
- ✅ Role-based checks on all staff resources
- ✅ Permission policies enforced
- ✅ No resource leakage between panels
- ✅ Staff can still access member panel for personal tasks

---

## Documentation Updates Needed

1. Update CLAUDE.md with panel architecture
2. Create staff panel user guide
3. Document panel switcher usage
4. Update onboarding docs for new staff members

---

## Conclusion

The staff panel split has been successfully implemented with:
- ✅ Clean separation between member and staff experiences
